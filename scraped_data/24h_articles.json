    "title": "How Ananda Lewis discovered she had breast cancer — and the regrets she had about her treatment plan",
    "sapo": "More than 42,000 U.S. women are expected to die of breast cancer in 2025. This week, former MTV VJ and TV host Ananda Lewis became one of them.",
    "content": "Ananda Lewis, a staple of MTV’s golden era, died this week after a lengthy battle with breast cancer. She was 52.\n\nIn the years leading up to her death, the beloved TV personality stirred controversy by opting for alternative treatments instead of a doctor-recommended double mastectomy — a decision she stood by until the end, though not without some regrets.\n\n“Do everything in your power to avoid my story becoming yours,” Lewis wrote in a candid essay for Essence published in January, reflecting on the choices she made both during her illness and long before cancer entered her life.\n\nLewis discovered a lump in her right breast while showering in December 2018. It was slightly larger than a pea and located where she’d often experienced mastitis while breastfeeding her son.\n\nThe former MTV Video jockey and TV host hoped it was nothing — but a biopsy the following month revealed stage III breast cancer that had already spread to her lymph nodes.\n\n“For a really long time, I have refused mammograms, and that was a mistake,” Lewis shared on Instagram when she went public with her diagnosis in October 2020.\n\n“If I had done the mammograms from the time they were recommended, when I turned 40, they would have caught the tumor in my breast years before I caught it through my own self-exam,” she continued.\n\nDespite the advanced stage, Lewis chose to face the diagnosis her way.\n\n“My approach in life is to deal with things head-on as they happen,” she wrote in Essence. “So instead of panicking, I made a game plan.”\n\nAfter seeing her mother and cousin go through traditional cancer treatment, she turned down doctors’ advice to undergo surgery to remove both her breasts, along with possible chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n“My plan at first was to get out excessive toxins in my body,” Lewis told CNN in an October 2024 interview. “I decided to keep my tumor and try to work it out of my body in a different way.”\n\nShe later admitted she had doubts about her decision. “Looking back on that, I go, ‘You know what? Maybe I should have,’” she said.\n\nInstead, she dove into research and overhauled her lifestyle, focusing on diet, detoxes and natural healing.\n\n“My goal was to do things that supported my body’s ability to continue to be whole enough to heal, instead of destroying it up front,” Lewis wrote in Essence.\n\nShe received monthly ultrasounds from a breast surgeon to track the tumor and committed to a mix of alternative therapies, including high-dose vitamin C IVs, hyperbaric chamber sessions, qigong, energy work and prayer.\n\nProgress was steady — until the COVID-19 pandemic hit. California shut down, and Lewis could no longer access her treatments or scans. “By the summer of 2020, I felt the tumor growing again,” she wrote.\n\nWith limited options in California, she traveled to Arizona, where medical clinics remained open. There, she underwent 16 weeks of integrative treatment, including acupuncture, cryoablation, and low-dose chemo.\n\nThe results were promising: her cancer dropped from stage III to stage II, it cleared from her lymph nodes, and her tumor shrank.\n\nBut the cost was steep. Without insurance, Lewis couldn’t keep up the treatments back home and had to pause care for more than two years while supporting herself and her son.\n\nBy October 2023, her cancer had progressed to stage IV.\n\nShe re-entered treatment at an integrative clinic in Southern California. After 12 weeks, by January 2024, her condition had improved significantly. But the toll of years without consistent care weighed on her.\n\n“Am I in the clear? No,” she wrote. “But I could have ended up here no matter what route I took, because I didn’t come in with the resources that I needed to stay the course the whole time.”\n\nDoctors generally advise against skipping surgery for breast cancer — especially in earlier stages.\n\n“In stage I to III breast cancer, which is curable, there’s no scenario that we can skip surgery altogether,” Dr. Stephanie Downs-Canner, a breast surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering, told Health.\n\nResearch consistently shows that women who refuse surgery have lower five-year survival rates and are more likely to die from the disease.\n\nStill, Lewis remained firm in her convictions.\n\n“I understand that people don’t get it,” she told host Shameika Rhymes on Soulibration in October 2024. “I still feel like I did the right thing. I need women to learn from my mistakes. I need them to learn from my victories.”\n\nLewis also said she regretted ignoring factors she now believes contributed to her illness — from chronic stress to poor nutrition and skipped screenings.\n\n“If I had known what I know now 10 years ago, perhaps I wouldn’t have ended up here,” she wrote in Essence. “I would’ve been doing all the things I’ve been forced to do now, to keep my body from creating more cancer and remove what it has already made.”\n\nShe urged women to manage stress, sleep well, stay active, get enough vitamin D, hydrate, eat clean and avoid environmental toxins.\n\n“Increase your knowledge about how to prevent getting here in the first place,” Lewis wrote. “Prevention is the real cure.”\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among US women after skin cancer, with one in eight expected to develop it in their lifetime. Rates are rising, especially among younger women and those who are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nDespite major advances in treatment and early detection, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among women — behind only lung cancer.\n\nBlack women are disproportionately affected, facing higher mortality rates at every age.\n\nIn 2025, the ACS expects 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in the US, and 42,170 women will die from the disease.\n\nMost major medical groups recommend women at average risk start annual mammograms at 40, according to breastcancer.org.\n\nThose at higher risk — due to family history, genetics, or other factors — are generally advised to begin annual mammograms at 30 and breast MRIs between ages 25 and 35."

    "sapo": "Enrolled Democrats will serve themselves and the entire city well by denying Zohran Mamdani any vote at all in the ranked-choice primary.",
    "content": "Enrolled Democrats will serve themselves and the entire city well by denying Zohran Mamdani any vote at all in the ranked-choice primary.\n\nWe know, it’s a dismal field; some will be tempted to rank Mamdani at least fifth to prevent one of the other horribles from triumphing, or as a sign of displeasure with the party establishment that’s failed so badly in offering any good alternatives.\n\nBut the fact remains: Mamdani is a uniquely awful menace, an utter guarantee of disaster for New York.\n\nHis stated plans on taxes and spending, policing and public safety, housing and education — on every aspect of city government — would drag Gotham down for everyone, perhaps most of all for those he pretends he’d benefit.\n\nHis free buses, free child care, city-run grocery stores and city-financed housing-construction promises alone would bankrupt City Hall. (He certainly has no secret vision for slashing other spending, except perhaps the NYPD.)\n\nHis marquee vow of zero rent hikes would devastate the city’s housing stock, pushing already-overstressed smaller landlords spiraling into bankruptcy and bringing a citywide version of the 1970s “The Bronx is burning” nightmare.\n\nAnd his “vision” for 200,000 new units of public housing defies even the lightest sniff test: New York still can’t figure out how to save its existing public-housing stock from falling down.\n\nEven he could somehow get the Legislature to pass $10 billion in tax hikes and not grab most of the windfall for itself, it wouldn’t remotely cover his spending plans — but would give NYC the highest corporate and individual rates in the nation.\n\nThat would provide “an $18,000 bonus for every millionaire earner who decamps for the ‘burbs,” calculates to the Manhattan Institute’s Ken Girardin — an even greater incentive to decamp to Palm Beach.\n\nOn the public safety front, Mamdani backed the “defund the police” movement and now proposes taking $1.1 billion from the NYPD for a new Department of Community Safety staffed by social workers, mental-heath specialists and gun violence interrupters.\n\nThat’s Bill de Blasio’s dreams, on steroids, but then Blas is Zohran’s favorite mayor.\n\nMamdani’s latest fit of genius, vow to pull police out of high-crime areas, is a clear giveaway of what side he’s truly on.\n\nAs is his landmark hatred of Israel and romanticizing of Hamas and other terrorists.\n\nNone of Mamdani’s rivals is as atrocious, even those now playing footsie with him; even if you detest one of the others even more, it’s easy enough to not rank either of them.\n\nNote, too, that this year’s Democratic primary isn’t at all a guarantee of victory in November: Mamdani is likely to fight on as the Working Parties Family nominee if he falters now; Andrew Cuomo has already arranged his own line for the fall — and Mayor Eric Adams will make the ballot as an independant along with Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n\nTen days of early voting began Saturday, June 14; primary day is June 24: Registered Democrats have a duty to reject extremism and keep Zohran Mamdani entirely off their ballots."

    "content": "Search and recovery teams continued scouring the site of one of India’s worst aviation disasters for a third day after the Air India flight fell from the sky and killed at least 270 people in Gujarat state, officials said Saturday.\n\nThe London-bound Boeing 787 struck a medical college hostel in a residential area of the northwestern city of Ahmedabad minutes after takeoff Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. One passenger survived.\n\nRecovery teams working until late Friday found at least 25 more bodies in the debris, officials said.\n\nDr. Dhaval Gameti at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad told The Associated Press the facility had received 270 bodies, adding that the lone surviving passenger was still under observation for some of his wounds.\n\n“He is doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon,” Gameti said Saturday.\n\nHundreds of relatives of the crash victims have provided DNA samples at the hospital. Most bodies were charred or mutilated, making them unrecognizable.\n\nSome relatives expressed frustration Saturday that the process was taking too long. Authorities say it normally takes up to 72 hours to complete DNA matching, and they are expediting the process.\n\n“Where are my children? Did you recover them?” asked Rafiq Abdullah, whose nephew, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren were on the flight. “I will have to ask questions. Government is not answering these questions.”\n\nAnother relative persistently asked hospital staff when his relative’s body would be handed over to the family for the last rites.\n\n“Give us the body,” the relative insisted.\n\nAlongside the formal investigation, the Indian government says it has formed a high-level, multi-disciplinary committee to examine the causes leading to the crash.\n\nThe committee will focus on formulating procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future and “will not be a substitute to other enquiries being conducted by relevant organisations,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement.\n\nRead more on the Air India plane crash\n• Miracle passenger survives Air India plane crash that killed over 200 people: ‘There were bodies all around me’\n• Air India plane carrying 242 people crashes soon after taking off from Indian city, police say\n• Shocking video reportedly shows power failures inside Air India plane hours before it crashed: ‘Nothing is working’\n• Doomed Air India passengers posted tragic video about their ‘magical trip’ just before crash: ‘Going back happily calm’\n\nAuthorities have begun inspecting Air India’s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Indian Minister of Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said Saturday in New Delhi at his first news briefing since Thursday’s crash.\n\nEight of the 34 Dreamliner aircraft in India have already undergone inspection, Kinjarapu said, adding that the remaining aircraft will be examined with “immediate urgency.”\n\nThe government is eagerly awaiting the results of the crash investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, and all necessary steps will be taken without hesitation, Kinjarapu said.\n\nInvestigators on Friday recovered the plane’s digital flight data recorder, or the black box, which was recovered from a rooftop near the crash site and likely will lead to clues about the cause of the accident.\n\nIndia’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said it had started working with “full force” to extract the data.\n\nThe device is expected to reveal information about the engine and control settings, while the voice recorder will provide cockpit conversations, said Paul Fromme, a mechanical engineer with the U.K.-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nAviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti, a former crash investigator for both the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, said investigators should be able to answer some important questions about what caused the crash as soon as next week, as long as the flight data recorder is in good shape.\n\nInvestigators likely are looking at whether wing flaps were set correctly, the engine lost power, alarms were going off inside the cockpit, and if the plane’s crew correctly logged information about the hot temperature outside and the weight of the fuel and passengers, Guzzetti said.\n\nMistakes in the data could result in the wing flaps being set incorrectly, he said.\n\nThursday’s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.\n\nThere are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide, and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts."

    "content": "The Edmonton Oilers got off the mat.\n\nDown, 2-1, in the best-of-seven series and trailing by three goals in Friday night’s Game 4, the Oilers staged a stunning comeback to get the Final back on level terms ahead of Sunday’s Game 5 in Alberta.\n\nThe Florida Panthers had the Oilers under siege for most of the first half of Game 4, but a power-play goal by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins turned the tide, and Edmonton came out on top, 5-4, in overtime thanks to a goal by Leon Draisaitl.\n\nFor most teams, a loss like that would be a gut punch and could cause things to spiral out of control. But the Panthers are built differently.\n\nThese Cats have weathered plenty of storms, including blowing a 3-0 series lead against these same Oilers in last year’s Final before winning Game 7.\n\nThere will likely be plenty of betting support for the Oilers in Game 5 based on the idea that they’ll carry the momentum from Friday night, but the Panthers deserve more credit than that.\n\nIn fact, the most important takeaway from Game 4, at least for bettors, was not that the Panthers lost but what’s going on in goal for the Oilers.\n\nStuart Skinner was pulled for the second straight game Friday night, and he has not been very sharp in this series.\n\nThe margins in this series are razor thin; the two teams have essentially split the goals, scoring chances and shot attempts down the middle at 5-on-5, so the goaltending battle could be the decisive factor.\n\nWhether Kris Knoblauch chooses to go back to Skinner or rolls with journeyman Calvin Pickard in Game 5, there is no question that the Panthers have the edge in the blue paint, at least on paper.\n• Check out the best NHL betting sites\n• Read our expert guide on how to bet on the NHL\n\nSergei Bobrovsky may not be at his best right now, but he’s got a terrific track record in the postseason and was the Conn Smythe favorite for Florida coming into the series.\n\nGoaltending is fickle and tough to project, but if Bobrovsky does find his A-game, it would be a massive boost for the Panthers, who have played the Oilers to a 50-50 split in just about every area of the game.\n\nMichael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry.

    "content": "Shane Lowry likely won’t be used in any promotional materials for Oakmont Country Club.\n\nThe 38-year-old Irishman had a hot-mic meltdown during Friday’s U.S. Open at the Pittsburgh-area course after missing a close putt for par on his fourth hole en route to his 17-over par finish.\n\n“F–k this place,” Lowry said before tapping in the bogey to place him at 14-over. “F–k this place.”\n\nOakmont is known for being a course that can mess with some of the world’s best and this year’s edition has been no different.\n\nLowry missed the cut by posting a 79-78 in his 36 holes, joining the likes of Phil Mickelson (8-over), 2016 winner Dustin Johnson (10-over) and 2024 champion Bryson DeChambeau (10-over) as standouts who will not be in action Saturday.\n\nIn 2016, Lowry had a much better run at the course by finishing tied for second with a 1-under showing.\n\nHe didn’t come close to replicating his effort this year.\n\nLowry bogeyed five holes and double bogeyed three times while finishing 9-over during his first 18 holes, before bogeying five holes again and double bogeying a pair to tally an 8-over mark Friday.\n\nThursday’s action featured Lowry taking out his frustrations on a microphone at the 17th hole after he could not get his ball out of the rough.\n\nFriday also featured Lowry making a mental blunder when he grabbed his ball on the 14th hole but failed to put his marker down, resulting in a one-stroke violation.\n\n“Probably one of the stupidest things I’ve ever done,” Lowry said with a laugh, per Yahoo. “I picked the ball up, had the ball in my hand, turned around to (caddie) Darren (Reynolds) and he basically said to me, ‘What the f–k are you doing?’ … By then, maybe my mind was somewhere else.”\n\nThis poor showing comes after Lowry finished second in a pair of events this year, including the Truist Championship last month.\n\nHe acknowledged before the tournament began that Oakmont can be “exhausting.”\n\n“I don’t know to be honest,” Lowry said of his showing, per Yahoo. “I drove it in play a lot (Thursday), did what I was supposed to do off the tee, and then just didn’t have my game that I’ve had for the last while. And then I really struggled on the greens (Thursday), and the round got away from me out here, and that was it.\n\n“They let it sort of do what they said it wouldn’t do, but that’s all fine, that’s the U.S. Open. I just made obviously too many doubles, too many big mistakes, and then when I got a couple chances, I didn’t convert them. I didn’t really do much right to be honest, other than I drove the ball as good as I’ve probably driven the ball in a long time. So, yeah, weird couple of days.”\n\nSam Burns is the course’s leader at 3-under entering Saturday’s action, while the scorching Scottie Scheffler needs a run at 4-over."

His wife, Jing Lei, formed a new company weeks after the couple moved to Brooklyn that import manifests show brought in roughly 8.5 tons of plastic bottles from China in May alone.\n\nThe Post found He, 48, did not disclose any of these business relationships on mandatory filings he made as chief-of-staff to Assemblyman William Colton (D-Brooklyn), a job he started in late 2023 while living in upstate New York.\n\nThe Cuomo campaign did not answer what sort of vetting process He underwent for the liaison job, and admitted He failed to properly disclose his business dealings to the Assembly, sending images of what it said were corrected filings in response to The Post’s questions.\n\n“Larry is a district leader and a known quantity in the community who does his job well,” said Cuomo spokeswoman Esther Jenson, who said any links to the CCP amounted to “guilt by association.”\n\nHe vehemently denied to The Post any involvement with the United Front or the CCP.\n\n“I’ve never been an asset beholden to the Chinese government and oppose any and all foreign government influence in our political process,” He told The Post. “Becoming an American citizen remains one of the highest honors of my life. The fact the CCP has been trying to assert itself is undeniable and something our community always looks out for.”\n\nHe acknowledged his relationships with the various Chinese state entities, but said he left the jobs in 2015 because he disliked the “bureaucratic” work and moved back to the U.S., where he had gotten his doctorate in the 2000s and where his wife and son lived.\n\nAnd He denied Australian news reports that he repeatedly visited the country to push import deals, and insisted he had only done “startup training” at the Chongqing-based Penshare-Banyu, despite being listed on its site as a partner in the firm.\n\nIn October 2024, He was photographed attending an October celebration of the 75th anniversary of the birth of the People’s Republic of China, alongside Brooklyn activist John Chan — who Wong has identified as the big wheel in the CCP’s New York machine.\n\nChan, 70, a one-time gangster who pleaded guilty to trafficking heroin and human trafficking, has participated in CCP events in the United States and China and publicly battled American policies supportive of the freedom of Hong Kong and the persecuted Uyghur ethnic minority. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs listed his activism on a webpage titled “Activities of Overseas Chinese Affairs and Chinese-Funded Institutions,” according to the Washington Post.\n\nCritics have accused Chan and his operatives of trying to oust anti-Beijing members of the New York State Assembly, and have warned of pro-CCP agents working to infiltrate local Chinese community events.\n\nChan has never faced formal allegations of spying but the FBI questioned him ahead of his trip to a CCP event on the mainland last year, according to the National Review, though no details of this interview have emerged. Chan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nHe admitted that he knew Chan from community events, but denied having any formal relationship with him. Wong acknowledged that these connections, like He’s business ties, do not prove he works for Beijing — but mark him as a figure with definite “political connections,” and likely a strong understanding of the CCP’s aims and interests.\n\n“Someone with his background who is active in local politics or American politics, that is something politicians like Cuomo should be aware of and should be mindful of,” Wong said of He.\n\nAfter moving permanently to the U.S. from China in 2016, He bought a $317,790 five-bedroom home the Syracuse suburbs with his wife, a longtime professor at the local state university, records show.\n\nHe formed his import firm there in 2018, and held the role of managing partner at OneStream Capital, which is headquartered in the town where he lived and was founded by a veteran of the Beijing-controlled China Venturetech Investment Corporation.\n\nHe took his job with Colton in December 2023, and told The Post he moved to Brooklyn for the gig, even though he kept his upstate home.\n\nIt wasn’t until November 2024 that He registered to vote in New York City, listing a rented condo on Bay Parkway in Bensonhurst as his residence and attesting on the form that he had never cast a ballot in his life. He said the registration coincided with him becoming a citizen.\n\nBarely a month after becoming a New York City voter, the Kings County Democratic Party — led by Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn — appointed He as a district leader. Just days after the appointment, He and his wife bought their own $830,000 condo on Kings Highway.\n\nIn March, He was named to Cuomo’s campaign — stunning community stalwarts.\n\n“I have experience in the Brooklyn community for 20 years, and I have no idea where he comes from,” said one Chinese-American activist, who works with immigrants in Bensonhurst and Sunset Park, and who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisals.\n\n“When I asked for more information about this person, it’s a mystery. Nobody knows where he comes from.”\n\nCuomo and other local pols have been a target of alleged CCP influence operations in the past, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIn September, federal prosecutors accused Linda Sun, who served as a Queens community liaison to Cuomo and Gov. Kathy Hochul in Albany, of working as an unregistered foreign agent for Beijing. Cuomo’s team has told The Post Sun had minimal access to the then-governor.\n\nLast summer, the feds arrested two accused Chinese agents who allegedly worked to subvert Taiwan-born pastor and freedom activist Xiong Yan’s bid for a New York congressional seat. In February 2024, the FBI raided the home of Winnie Greco, a longtime ally to John Chan and an aide to Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nThese are all reasons Cuomo should be more cautious vetting his staff, said Yaqiu Wang, a veteran human rights researcher who has studied the United Front and the CCP’s transnational influence operations.\n\n“At this point, it’s hardly surprising that individuals with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party are working for politicians in New York,” said Wang.\n\n“Allowing CCP-affiliated individuals and entities to influence American electoral politics isn’t just a national security threat—it’s a human rights issue. New York has long been a refuge for people fleeing repression in China: pro-democracy activists, Tibetans, Uyghurs, and others who came seeking a place where they could speak freely,” she added."

Smith may not have played his cards right.\n\nThe polarizing ESPN personality is being criticized for playing the popular card game Solitaire during the Thunder’s 111-104 road win over the Pacers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals on Friday, with even rival NBA player Kevin Durant joining in on the mocking.\n\nDurant posted to his Instagram story the image of Smith playing the game while at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\n\n“CMON STEVE,” Durant wrote on the bottom of the photo.\n\nSmith maintained he only turned to the mobile version of the game during a stoppage in play in a response to a quote tweet from popular NBA aggregator on X @LegionHoops showing him playing cards.\n\n“Yep! That’s me. Who would’ve thought….I can multi-task. Especially during TIMEOUTS!” Smith wrote in a quote tweet of the post. “Hope y’all are enjoying the NBA Finals. This is going 7 games now, peeps!”\n\nHowever, not everyone is buying that response.\n\nThe community note on Smith’s post claims he’s fabricating his story and linked to a video showing Smith playing the game during in-game action.\n\n“Stephen A. Is lying. This photo was taken during gameplay, NOT during a timeout,” the community note states.\n\nThe video linked in the post came from user @feellikedrew, who posted a video showing the Thunder going for a basket before cutting to Smith with the game on his phone.\n\nThe end of the clip showed the Pacers running a play.\n\n“Bro talks about knowing ball,” the caption read. “He’s playing solitaire during the NBA finals.”\n\nSmith attempted to get the last laugh by posting just after midnight a photo showing a Solitaire hand with an inset image from when the Pacers led, 87-80, with 11:36 remaining in the game.\n\nThe Thunder outscored the Pacers, 12-1, in the final three minutes to even the series at 2-2.\n\nPacers fans and Durant are upset with the controversial Smith for comments he’s made.\n\nSmith would not classify Indiana star Tyrese Haliburton as a superstar and then fired at Haliburton after the guard chirped at NBA pundits — he didn’t name Smith specifically — after pulling the Game 3 upset.\n\n“Oh, by the way, just in case he was talking about me. My brother, I’m not going away,” Smith said on “First Take” on Thursday. “I’m going to be here for a while. .. Players far more accomplished and far more superior have made their efforts trying to call me out. How has that worked out?”\n\nThe feud between Durant and Smith goes back years and the NBA star called him out in April for being too distracted to digest enough basketball after Smith mocked his leadership.\n\n“Steve is trying to run for president, u think he actually paid attention to a struggling team??” Durant said in reference to the Suns. “It’s called propaganda.”"

But even there, I don’t have much hope for Usman.\n\nBuckley’s takedown defense has improved dramatically, stopping wrestling attempts from fellow college wrestler Colby Covington last time out.\n\nIf Buckley is as improved as we’ve seen in recent fights, I suspect he wins this fight rather easily, especially if Usman is getting hit with hard punches.\n\nBuckley wins this one, potentially by knockout, but I’ll again go to a same-game-parlay to lower the price of a big favorite at the top of the card.\n\nThe “Golden Boy” is back in the Octagon after previously being on the fast track to welterweight title contention.\n\nEdmen Shahbazyan then fell on hard times, unable to stop a takedown, seemingly even if his life depended on it.\n\nAt one point early in his career, Shahbazyan was headlining fight cards, but his 65 percent take-down defense rate is simply not going to cut it at this level.\n\nGet the lowdown on the Best USA Sports Betting Sites and Apps\n• Check out the best sports betting sites\n\nFrom a fight promotion perspective, I hate this booking for Shahbazyan, as Petroski is a college wrestler from the University of North Carolina and Bloomsburg University.\n\nPetroski is always game and trains at Marquez MMA in Philadelphia, home of Joe Pyfer and Sean Brady.\n\nShahbazyan has the better striking, but we have zero proof he’s improved his takedown defense enough that he can compete on the ground with a college wrestler.\n\nBack Petroski here as the underdog, as Shahbazyan’s suspect takedown defense makes him a major liability as a favorite.\n\nCody Garbrandt vs. Raoni Barcelos: Fight goes to decision (-102, FanDuel)\n\nAlonzo Menifield vs. Oumar Sy: Sy by KO/TKO in Round 2 or 3 (+650, FanDuel)\n\nMichael Chiesa vs. Court McGee: Chiesa by submission in Round 2 or 3 (+460, FanDuel)\n\nMalcolm Wellmaker vs. Kris Moutinho: Wellmaker by KO/TKO in Round 2 or 3 (+210, FanDuel)\n\nErich Richter is a brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt but he has a black belt in MMA betting. During the football season he’s showcased massive profits at The Post in the player prop market the last two seasons.

    "content": "A convicted Al-Qaeda sympathizer who conspired to kill Americans in shopping malls and traveled to the Mideast to train with the terror group was teaching kids at a Muslim community center on Staten Island.\n\nTarek Mehanna — who prosecutors say once vowed to wage armed jihad against Americans both here and abroad — began teaching Arabic and the Quran in January to children as young as 4 at the Muslim Community Center of Staten Island in West Brighton.\n\nMohamed Bahi, a former senior advisor to Mayor Adams and the Muslim Community Center of Staten Island’s founder, announced Mehanna’s hiring in a since-deleted Facebook post, promoting the MCC’s Jan. 11 grand opening. Mehanna’s photo was pictured prominently among headshots of imams and other center officials in promotions.\n\nAdams has visited the MCC in Brooklyn in the past.\n\nMehanna, 43, taught four days a week, four hours per day.\n\n“I’m all for second chances — but not when it comes to convicted terrorists teaching kids. That’s not rehabilitation — that’s insanity,” said City Councilman Frank Morano (R-Staten Island).\n\nThe Sept. 11 attacks inspired the terror teacher and galvanized his radicalization, according to federal prosecutors. Mehanna and his unnamed co-conspirators were undeterred when denied entry into Afghanistan at the Pakistan border in 2002, and “agreed to explore ways in which they, too, could kill Americans.”\n\nWhen the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, Mehanna discussed purchasing automatic guns with his co-conspirators to murder US citizens inside shopping malls, “but [they] ultimately dismissed them as impractical,” according to prosecutors.\n\nTheir focus then shifted towards killing American soldiers, whom Mehanna called “infidels,” according to court records.\n\n“They discussed many options,” reads the government’s 2012 sentencing memoradum, which asked a judge to send Mehanna away for life. Ultimately, they decided in 2004 to “seek training in Yemen, sought guidance on how to obtain it, received contacts, equipped and readied themselves for the journey, and made arrangements to sneak out of Massachusetts.”\n\nAfter days criss-crossing Yemen’s hostile landscape, “braving brigands and once facing down an AK-47,” the group failed to “find a suitable training camp” and “Mehanna returned to the United States disappointed but no less determined to provide support to America’s enemies.”\n\nThe one-time pharmacist worked in an upscale Boston suburb. He attended an Al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan later in 2004, where he received “paramilitary training so that he could eventually join Al-Qaeda in Iraq in fighting and killing American soldiers,” prosecutors said.\n\nMehanna spent the last 14 years at the federal pen in Florence, CO, after being convicted in 2011 of providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy to commit murder, and making false statements to the FBI.\n\nMehanna lied about his Yemeni trip when questioned by federal agents, and later translated jihadist propaganda and distributed it online, along with Al-Qaeda recruitment videos, officials said.\n\nProsecutors further stated Mehanna, whose best friend was Islamist extremist Daniel Joseph Maldonado, “enjoyed viewing” and immersing himself in footage of the beheadings of Pennsylvania contractor Nick Berg, New Jersey contractor Paul Johnson, and Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.\n\nHe showed the horrific videos during “movie nights” he hosted, according to prosecutors, who said Mehanna idolized Iraqi terror leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who killed Berg.\n\n“He prolifically distributed a video of the mutilation of American soldiers in Iraq, described how one could see the internal organs and ribs, and then said, ‘Texas BBQ is the way to go,'” prosecutors said.\n\n“This is the role model that kids should be looking up to?” seethed former Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind. “This is a role model? Someone desperate to become a terrorist? It’s a model of terrorism.\n\n“We know what he stands for and what he’s about — what is he teaching these children?” asked Hikind, the founder of Americans Against Antisemitism.\n\nWhile in federal custody, a treatise attributed to Mehanna was posted to a Facebook page calling for his release. In the post, he likened the entire Muslim world to the human body, and compared America to AIDS.\n\nFollowing his release in late August, Mehanna mocked the deaths of Israeli soldiers on Facebook, writing “Poor baby” above videos he shared in both October and November.\n\nHe also ridiculed Sgt. Quandarius Davon Stanley, 23, who was killed May 23, 2024, while delivering aid to Gaza on President Biden’s failed floating pier.\n\nIn December, Mehanna translated a speech by Abdullah Azzam, one of Osama bin Laden’s mentors, and shared the lecture — about Marwan Hadid, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria — in a now-deleted Facebook post.\n\nThe MCC of Staten Island, affiliated with the Muslim Community Center in Brooklyn, only just filed its not-for-profit incorporation documents with the Department of State’s Division of Corporations on June 5.\n\nAn unnamed official with MCC Brooklyn on Saturday morning claimed Mehanna’s work with the center “ended over a month ago.”\n\n“He is no longer teaching at our center. We are a diverse community that believes in second chances and those that want to change themselves through service and education,” said the email.\n\nThe MCC gave no further details on why Mehanna was hired or on his departure, and gave no contact information for him.\n\n“It’s clear he still harbors the same anti-American hatred he held before his sentence,” blasted City Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (R-Brooklyn). “The ‘education’ these children are receiving is being administered on American soil and should reflect the values and interests of our nation.”\n\nAsked Vernikov: “Do any of us really believe that someone who was convicted for colluding with Al Qaeda — a terrorist organization that’s committed terrorist acts on American soil and shed American blood — is truly ‘reformed’ and won’t continue to collude with other terrorists, and won’t indoctrinate the children in his care into a radical jihadist ideology?”"

    "content": "A Queens couple’s European jaunt came to blistering end when a flight attendant allegedly dumped “excessively” hot coffee in the woman’s lap, according to a lawsuit.\n\nAymara and Giuseppe Corbo were on a connecting flight from Copenhagen to Oslo on April 3, 2024, heading to a cruise around the British Isles, when beverage service began around 10 a.m., they said in court papers.\n\nThat’s when a Scandinavian Airlines flight attendant allegedly spilled the steaming hot cup of java while serving it to Aymara, 78, causing the bookkeeper to suffer “severe burns, pain, suffering” and “scarring and cosmetic deformity,” the couple said in the litigation.\n\nThe Corbos, both retired, are seeking $10 million in damages for the injured wife, and another $1 million for her husband, 86, a former employee for the New York City Housing Authority.\n\nThe painful incident left the pair “pretty much room bound” during the more than two-week excursion, according to their lawyer, Jonathan Reiter.\n\nScandinavian Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "content": "The two Gotti brothers who brazenly beat down their brother-in-law in Queens also accidentally punched a woman who entered the fray, video obtained exclusively by The Post shows.\n\nA witness filmed part of the June 2 assault allegedly carried out in Howard Beach by John and Frankie Gotti, grandsons of the late “Teflon Don” John Gotti.\n\nIn the footage, one of the brothers, dressed in a white T-shirt, is spotted outside a home on 84th Street, on the passenger side of a white Mercedes Benz SUV. The other brother is on the driver’s side of the vehicle.\n\nA man can be seen throwing punches in the direction of a taller man — presumably Gino Gabrielli, who is the brother of John’s wife, Eleanor Gabrielli — and an unidentified woman.\n\nOne of the Gotti boys’ blows appears to hit both Gabrielli and the woman, who was standing between the Gotti bro and Gabrielli in a bid to protect the latter.\n\nSeveral neighbors told The Post they did not recognize the woman in the video, who appears to have been socked in the face.\n\nIn the brief clip, a woman can be heard yelling, “Right now!”\n\nJohn, 31, and Frankie, 27, were hit with third-degree attempted assault and harassment charges by prosecutors for allegedly slugging Gabrielli, whom they said burglarized one of their homes.\n\nGabrielli was allegedly caught on camera entering a bedroom window at John Gotti’s Jamaica house, according to a criminal complaint obtained by The Post.\n\nHe allegedly stole $3,000, a pair of his sister’s earrings, a watch, wallet and belt, the criminal complaint states.\n\nGabrielli was arrested and charged with second-degree burglary, third-degree grand larceny and third-degree criminal possession of stolen property.\n\nBut following his supervised release, John and Frankie, who are the sons of Peter Gotti, allegedly went looking for their brother-in-law, sources previously told The Post.\n\nThe two brothers pleaded not guilty in Queens Criminal Court.\n\nJohn and Frank’s famous granddad led the Gambino crime family for decades and was finally convicted of murder and racketeering in 1992 after endlessly frustrating the feds.\n\nThe high-profile mob patriarch died in jail at 61 in 2002."
